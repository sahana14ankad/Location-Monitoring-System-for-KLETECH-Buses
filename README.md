# Location-Monitoring-System-for-KLETECH-Buses
ABSTRACT:

The public transportation system requires effective tracking and monitoring of bus
locations for efficient operations and improved passenger experience. Hence, the tracking
and monitoring of bus locations is crucial. In this work, we propose a system that
automates the recording of GPS-based locations for KLETECH buses using IoT devices
and a web/mobile application. Each bus will be equipped with an IoT device, such
as an ESP32 microcontroller with a A7672x evaluation board with GNSS, which will
periodically send the bus’s GPS coordinates to the Cloud platform for storage and analysis.
A web/mobile application is developed to provide a user-friendly interface for accessing
the recorded bus location data, generating reports, and setting up alerts. The proposed
system will leverage the capabilities of firebase, a cloud-based IoT analytics platform, to
store and analyze the GPS data. Firebase APIs and libraries are used to integrate the
IoT devices with the platform, enabling seamless data transmission and storage. The
secure authentication mechanisms are implemented to prevent unauthorized access to
the system. The monitoring mechanisms, such as logging and alerting, will be in place
to ensure system reliability and performance. The proposed system will also provide
real-time visibility of bus locations, enabling KLETECH to make data-driven decisions
for improved operational efficiency and enhanced passenger experience.

INTRODUCTION:

KLETECH, a leading educational institution, provides transportation services to its
students for their daily commute. As the number of students using the transportation
service is increased, the need for an automated system to track the location of KLETECH
buses has become crucial. This system will provide real-time location data for each bus,
enabling students to plan their travel accordingly and improving overall efficiency of the
transportation service.
To address this need, we propose a system that will use IoT devices installed in each
KLETECH bus to collect and transmit GPS-based location data to a centralized web
and/or mobile application. The application will store and analyze the data, providing
reports and alerts to stakeholders. This system will enhance the overall efficiency of the
transportation service, allowing KLETECH to provide better services to the students.
The proposed system will consist of IoT devices equipped with location sensors, installed
in each KLETECH bus. These IoT devices will be connected to the centralized web and/or
mobile application through a wireless network, allowing for real-time data transmission.
The web and/or mobile application will provide a user-friendly interface for data storage,
analysis, and visualization.
Furthermore, the system will be equipped with advanced analytics capabilities to
generate reports and alerts based on predefined rules. Stakeholders, including KLETECH
transportation administrators, and students, will receive alerts via email, SMS, or app
notifications in case of any delays or deviations from planned routes.
Furthermore, the proposed system will enhance the safety and security of KLETECH
students. In the event of an emergency, administrators can quickly identify the location
of each bus and ensure the safety of students on board. The system can also be used to
monitor driving behavior, ensuring that drivers adhere to safety standards and operate
vehicles in a responsible manner.
Overall, the proposed system will provide a comprehensive solution for tracking the
location of KLETECH buses in real-time, enabling better planning and decision-making
for all stakeholders involved in the transportation service.


MOTIVATION: 

One of the primary motivations is to enhance the safety and security of students who
use college buses to commute to and from college. With a tracking system, the college
can monitor the movement of its buses and ensure that students reach their destination
safely. In case of any emergency, the system can also be used to alert authorities and
take necessary actions. With a tracking system, students can know the exact location
and arrival time of their bus, which will help them to plan their schedule better and
avoid waiting for long hours at the bus stop. In case of efficiency,the system can provide
real-time data of location and status of each bus, allowing administrators to optimize their
routes, reduce wait times. By optimizing bus routes and reducing wait times. Overall, a
college bus tracking system can benefit both students and administrators in several ways,
including safety, convenience, efficiency, cost savings, and improved communication.

CLOUD PLATFORM: 


Google’s Firebase is a tool that makes it simple for developers to create, maintain, and
expand their apps. It makes it easier for developers to create apps more quickly and
securely. Because there is no programming required on the firebase side, it is simple to
use the features more effectively. It offers services to web, unity, android, and ios. It offers
online storage. The database used for data storage is a NoSQL one.

1.  Realtime Database: The Firebase Realtime Database is a NoSQL database that runs
in the cloud and maintains data at a blistering millisecond pace. It can be compared
to a large JSON file in the simplest terms.
2.  Cloud Firestore: A NoSQL document database, the cloud Firestore offers capabilities
including worldwide syncing, querying, and storage through the application. In the
form of objects, also referred to as Documents, it holds data. It can store any type
of data, including texts, binary data, and even JSON trees, and has a key-value pair.
3.  Authentication: To allow users to access your app, the Firebase Authentication
service offers simple-to-use UI frameworks and SDKs. The amount of labour and
time needed to create and maintain the user authentication service is decreased.
Even complicated manual chores like merging accounts are handled by it.
4.  Remote Config: The service for remote configuration aids in instantly publishing
updates to the user. The modifications could involve anything from changing UI
elements to altering how the applications behave. These are frequently utilised for
posting seasonal offers and contents to applications with short lifespans.

FLOW CHART:

The Figure 3.2 is the process we carried to implement this project. When the power
button is pressed, the system initiates a check for the blinking of a green light. If
the green light is blinking, it indicates that the GSM module with the model number
A7672S is functioning properly and has established a connection. Once the connection is
established, the system gathers longitude and latitude data, which is then sent to Firebase,
a cloud-based platform. In Firebase, the location data is stored and made available for
retrieval by both a mobile app and a web app. Users can access these applications to view
the current location of the buses. The mobile app provides a convenient way for users to
track the buses on their smartphones, while the web app offers a browser-based option
for accessing the same information.
